          You probably dont know me, but like you I am one of those .01%ers, a proud and unapologetic capitalist. I have founded, co-founded and funded more than 30 companies 
          across a range of industries—from itsy-bitsy ones like the nightclub I started in my 20s to giant ones like Amazon.com. Then I founded aQuantive, an Internet advertising 
          company that was sold to Microsoft in 2007 for $6.4 billion. In cash.
        </p>
        <p>
          My friends and I own a bank. I tell you all this to demonstrate that in many ways Im no different from you. Like you, I have a broad perspective on business and 
          capitalism. And also like you, I have been rewarded obscenely for my success, with a life that the other 99.99 percent of Americans cant even imagine. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You know what Im talking about. In 1992, I was selling pillows made by my familys business and the Internet was a novelty. But I saw pretty quickly, even back then, 
          that as soon as the Internet became fast and trustworthy enough—and that time wasnt far off—people were going to shop online like crazy. Realizing that, seeing over 
          the horizon a little faster than the next guy, was the strategic part of my success.

          But the problem isnt that we have inequality. Some inequality is intrinsic to any high-functioning capitalist economy. The problem is that inequality is at 
          historically high levels and getting worse every day. Our country is rapidly becoming less a capitalist society and more a feudal society. Unless our policies change 
          dramatically, the middle class will disappear, and we will be back to late 18th-century France. Before the revolution, worlds: Wake up, people. It wont last.
        </p>
        <p>
          No society can sustain this kind of rising inequality. In fact, there is no example in human history where wealth accumulated like this and the pitchforks didnt 
          eventually come out. You show me a highly unequal society, and I will show you a police state. Or an uprising. There are no counterexamples. None. Its not if, its when.

          Many of us think were special because “this is America.” We think were immune to the same forces that started the Arab Spring—or the French and Russian revolutions, for 
          that matter. I know you fellow .01%ers tend to dismiss this kind of argument; Ive had many of you tell me to my face Im completely bonkers3.

                What everyone wants to believe is that when things reach a tipping point and go from being merely crappy4 for the masses to dangerous and socially destabilizing, 
                that were somehow going to know about that shift ahead of time.

                Any student of history knows thats not the way it happens. Revolutions

                If we do something about it, if we adjust our policies so that we 
                help the 99.99 percent and preempt5 the revolutionaries and crazies, 
                the ones with the pitchforks—that will be the best thing possible for us

                The most ironic thing about rising inequality is how completely 
                unnecessary and self-defeating it is.
